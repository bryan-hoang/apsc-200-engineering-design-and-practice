# APSC 200: Engineering Design and Practice II

A project for a [2nd-year engineering design course][apsc-200] using MATLAB to
simulate the Group Formation of a [Multi-Agent System (MAS)][mas].

Specifically, the MATLAB App uses [Lloyd's Algorithm][lloyd-algo] to simulate
how robotic bees would distribute over an area to pollinate unpollinated
plants/flowers.

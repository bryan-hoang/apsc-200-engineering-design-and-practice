# Group-Formation-of-a-Multi-Agent-System

A project for a 2nd-year design course using MATLAB to simulate the Group Formation of a Multi-Agent System.

Specifically, the MATLAB App uses Lloyd's Algorithm to simulate how robotic bees would distribute over an area to pollinate unpollinated plants/flowers.
